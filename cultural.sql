HTTP Tunneling is a method for connecting to a server that uses the same protocol (http://) and the same port (port 80) as a web server does. Navicat Data Modeler is a powerful and cost-effective database design tool which helps you build high-quality conceptual, logical and physical data models. Navicat Monitor can be installed on any local computer or virtual machine and does not require any software installation on the servers being monitored. To successfully establish a new connection to local/remote server - no matter via SSL, SSH or HTTP, set the database login information in the General tab.
